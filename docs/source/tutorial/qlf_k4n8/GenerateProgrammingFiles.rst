Generate the Programming Files  
===============================

The technology mapped netlist and packing/placement/routing results produced by VPR contain the information needed to generate a device programming bitstreams.
These bitstreams can be used to configure the qlf_k4n8 eFPGA device for validation:

1. Bitstream File
2. FourByte File

Bitstream File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This programming file is the binary bitstream file with extension "*.bin". It will be generated by default after the PnR run by Symbiflow.


Four Byte File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This programming file is the 4Byte/hex file with extension "*.bit". It will be generated by default post PnR run by Symbiflow.
